He was third on GC after the inaugural time trial. Race leader Rohan Dennis wasn't in the front group yesterday at the difference of runner up Tony Martin but Cancellara's third place on the finishing line in Neeltje Jans awarded him four seconds of time bonus, so he now leads the race by 3 seconds over Martin, 6 seconds over Tom Dumoulin and 33 seconds over Peter Sagan.

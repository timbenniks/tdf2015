It's quite unusual at the Tour de France since the distinctive leader's jersey was implemented in 1919, at the exception of stage 1 in which the defending champion used to race in yellow until a new rule prevented it from 2008 onwards. The last time it happened was in stage 17 of the 2007 Tour de France when Michael Rasmussen was withdrawn from the race by his own team (Rabobank). Alberto Contador became the race leader only at the end of that stage. In 1991, Rolf Sorensen arrived in Valenciennes with a broken collarbone like Tony Martin yesterday. The Dane considered showing up at the start in Arras the next day and signing in because one more day in the lead would have awarded him ten UCI points. He eventually didn't. Runner up Greg LeMond waited for two more days and the time trial from Argentan – the location of today's intermediate sprint – to Alençon to take the yellow jersey after an interim by Thierry Marie. The most famous episode of them all happened in 1971 when Eddy Merckx refused to wear the yellow jersey he got after Luis Ocaña's crash in the downhill of col de Menté. In 2005, after taking over from his compatriot David Zabriskie who crashed in the team time trial to Blois, Lance Armstrong tried to emulate Merckx but the rules of cycling had changed in the meantime. A rider who refuses to wear a distinctive jersey faces to be excluded from the race according to current UCI regulations. Today's case is similar to 1991 and 2007 but different from 1971 and 2005 when Merckx and Armstrong became the race leader at the end of the stage preceding the day they didn't want the jersey. Since then, Armstrong has been stripped off most of his results at the Tour de France.","ev":44,"status":"point-historique"}}
